# deepfake-detection-challenge-dataset-practice
Uses BlazeFace for face detection using pretrained model from Google's MediaPipe framework with some changes that can be found at https://github.com/hollance/BlazeFace-PyTorch

Additionally, the starter kit comes from a Kaggle notebook at https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/deepfake-starter-kit

Requires python, numpy, PyTorch, pandas, OpenCV, matplotlib

For this repository to work, video files need to be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/deepfake-starter-kit/#data
